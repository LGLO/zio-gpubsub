# ZIO wrapper for Google Cloud PubSub (HTTP)

**This is work-in-progress**

This is ZIO wrapper for Google Cloud PubSub (HTTP) actions.

Intended functionality for first release is to publish messages, pull messages, ack messages and admin operations: create/delete topics and subscriptions.

*It should work with real cloud PubSub and with the emulator.*
Code using it should be testable.

# TODO
* mdoc or docusaurus or other docs
* circleci - build branches, PRs, publish artifact
* crossbuild for Scala 2.12, 2.13, dotty

**This is work-in-progress**
